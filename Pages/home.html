	<p>Here you'll find information about me, Nathan Blair, including my resume, portfolio, contact information, and perhaps in the future, some of my news. <br><br>
	Feel free to look around and drop me a line if you have any questions or would like to find out more. Thanks for visiting!</p>

	<p><b>A Note</b> : This site is under active development and subject to change without notice. It currently is meant to be viewed using a full-windowed web browser. That being said, in the near future I hope to implement responsive design methods to allow smaller screen devices and viewports to get similar functionaility. I am not a website development or a graphic design professional. This site was built from the ground up by me from editing raw HTML5 and CSS3. All credits go to the Mozilla Developer Network, CodeAcademy, and W3Schools for providing the necessary information to get me started. More credit where it is due: my personal site is highly inspired by <a href="http://www.anthonydesigner.com/">this site</a> whose quality I can't fathom ever actually attaining but it was a large inspiration for the layout, format, and future functionality.</p>
