		<b>A Note</b> : This site is under active development and subject to change without notice. It currently is meant to be viewed using a full-windowed web browser. That being said, in the near future I hope to implement responsive design methods to allow smaller screen devices and viewports to get similar functionaility. I am not a website development or a graphic design professional. This site was built from the ground up by me from editing raw HTML5 and CSS3. All credits go to the Mozilla Developer Network, CodeAcademy, and W3Schools for providing the necessary information to get me started. More credit where it is due: my personal site is highly inspired by <a href="http://www.anthonydesigner.com/">this site</a> whose quality I can't fathom ever actually attaining but it was a large inspiration for the layout, format, and future functionality. <br> <br>
		Also, I have added 0 scripts to this page. I believe in minimizing the amount of scripting on websites to allow for the widest range of compatibility and for the best user experience. Having said that, I am using a few of Google's Open Fonts and thus there is a script that wants to run to be able to retrieve those fonts. This script is not required to view everything on the site but I did choose fonts that I think look...prettier. There are also no ads running on this page nor will there ever be. I have considered using Google Analytics for tracking traffic but haven't done so at this time. I run my site while trying to support as many FLOSS methods as possible, and all my page traffic is hosted from GitHub's awesome GitHub Pages feature.
