		I had an interview the other week that went really well. I'll say that, being a multidisciplinary engineer, I'm uniquely suited to filling certain kinds of rolls in engineering departments. That's not me tooting my own horn (well, maybe a little), that is just what I've spent my professional life developing as my skillset. I'm most valuable in roles where I can wear multiple hats and interface with multiple disciplines and departments. Its what I'm good at.

		It wasn't enough to get the job though. I got the boilerplate "it was very hard but we found someone who better fits the position we're trying to fill" response; my mother aptly calls them "you-suck letters".

		No worries though. I'm not discouraged and will continue trying to find a career in this industry. Despite not having a Computer Science degree, I still have two other engineering degrees that show I'm more than capable of learning advanced mathematical and abstract concepts plus 5 years worth of disciplined and rigorous self-taught programming experience and projects.
