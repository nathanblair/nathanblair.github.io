		<h1>Hire-Me Banner</h1>
		<h3>3/29/2017</h3>

		<h5>Try a working example of this widget on jsfiddle <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/TheThinker/LLhv5o68/13/" target="_blank">here</a>.</h5>

		<p>
			This site has been pretty cool to work on and I think its effective in telling my story but...it doesn't do a great job in achieving some of my metrics. Therefore, I'm shutting it down. Its been real guys.
		</p>

		<p>
			Obviously I'm kidding! I've worked <i>way</i> too hard on this site to just let it go now. Really though, this site could be doing a better job in generating higher CTR. What kind of metrics/CTR would a personal blog need? Why, a contact banner to hire me! So I made one. And now, I'm going to give a quick demo of how you can make one too. A lot of the UX basis for this widget is going to come from the <a href="#css-nav-dropdown">pure CSS nav menu </a> discussed in one of my previous posts. Let's. Get. Started.
		</p>

		<h4>The HTML</h4>

		<p>
			I love simple HTML. This widget is no different! I embedded my banner in an <span class="code">&lt;aside&gt;</span> tag because (<i>ahem</i>) we're going to <i>cast it aside</i>, now how about that? Ugh. Moving on! We're putting our old friends the checkbox and its label, along with an anchor tag that will use the mailto URL fragment, into this aside element. Here's what that looks like:
		</p>

		<section class="blockcode">
			&lt;aside class="banner"&gt;<br>
				<span class="indent">&lt;input type="checkbox" id="box"/&gt;</span><br>
				<span class="indent">&lt;label id="toggle" for="box"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;</span><br><br>
				<span class="indent">&lt;a id="collapsible" href="mailto:me@email.com?</span><br>
				<span class="indent">subject=Opportunities (From website.com)&body=</span><br>
				<span class="indent">Blah blah blah blah blah.%0D%0A</span><br>
				<span class="indent">Blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah? Here's my contact infomration: %0D%0A%0D%0A</span><br>
				<br>
				<span class="indent">Name: %0D%0A</span><br>
				<span class="indent">Phone: %0D%0A</span><br>
				<span class="indent">E-Mail: %0D%0A%0D%0A</span><br>
				<br>
				<span class="indent">Thanks,%0D%0A%0D%0A&gt;"</span><br>
				<span class="double-indent">Ready to hire me? Send me an e-mail!</span><br>
				<span class="indent">&lt;/a&gt;</span><br>
			&lt;/aside&gt;<br>
		</section>

		<p>
			Bam. HTML's done. Simple! I love it. I only wish the CSS were quite so easy...
		</p>

		<h4>The CSS</h4>

		<p>
			Let's start with the banner itself. This element, for me, is something I want prominently (but not annoyingly) displayed at all times. So I'm going to set it as a fixed position element, somewhere near the top right corner of the page. Out of the way but accessible if someone decides they want to get a hold of me about an opportunity! Inside this <span class="code">&lt;aside&gt;</span> container is the checkbox, its label, and the anchor itself. All four of these need to be styled. You'll notice the styling of the checkbox and its label should be pretty similar to the dropdown widget's style. First, the banner:
		</p>

		<section class="blockcode">
			.banner {<br>
			<span class="indent">position: fixed;</span><br>
			<span class="indent">top: 100px;</span><br>
			<span class="indent">right: 20px;</span><br>
			<span class="indent">font-size: 1.1em;</span><br>
			<span class="indent">text-align: center;</span><br>
			}
		</section>

		<p>
			The checkbox graphic is very easy.
		</p>

		<section class="blockcode">
			#box {<br>
			<span class="indent">display: none;</span><br>
			}
		</section>

		<p>
			That one's done. Next, the shared settings for the checkbox label and the anchor link.
		</p>

		<section class="blockcode">
			#toggle, #collapsible {<br>
			<span class="indent">display: block;</span><br>
			<span class="indent">color: white;</span><br>
			<span class="indent">text-decoration: none;</span><br>
			<span class="indent">cursor: pointer;</span><br>
			}
		</section>

		<p>
			And then the individual settings for the checkbox label and anchor link.
		</p>

		<section class="blockcode">
			#toggle {<br>
			<span class="indent">float: left;</span><br>
			<span class="indent">background-color: rgba(250, 0, 0, 0.7)</span><br>
			<span class="indent">padding: 10px 6px 10px 10px;</span><br>
			<span class="indent">/*border-bottom-left-radius: 2px;*/</span><br>
			<span class="indent">/*border-top-left-radius: 2px;*/</span><br>
			}<br>
			<br>
			#collapsible {<br>
			<span class="indent">float: right;</span><br>
			<span class="indent">background-color: rgba(220, 70, 0, 0.7)</span><br>
			<span class="indent">padding: 10px 16px 10px 4px;</span><br>
			<span class="indent">/*border-bottom-right-radius: 2px;*/</span><br>
			<span class="indent">/*border-top-right-radius: 2px;*/</span><br>
			<span class="indent">white-space: nowrap;</span><br>
			<span class="indent">transition: padding 1s;</span><br>
			}
		</section>

		<p>
			Note that I have not set a width for the #collapsible element; this prevents me from animating the full width shrinking effect but I can't stress how much I dislike hard coding those kinds of things. It only leads to site problems and bad user experiences. Anyway, I've also included the nowrap settings for the white-space property. As the #collapsible shrinks the text will get pushed and automatically wrap itself downward, expanding the height of the entire .banner. In turn, this makes the #toggle look funny. Best to just avoid that altogether and set a nowrap!
		</p>

		<p>
			That wraps up (huehue) the display of all the elements. Now we need to implement their behavior using our friend the checkbox's <span class="code">:checked</span> pseudo-class. I left the label's container devoid of any content so that I could set it using the #toggle's <span class="code">:after</span> pseudo-class. When the checkbox is not checked, the label shows a fitting '/>' close tag that demonstrates that clicking the anchor will collapse the banner. After clicking the '/>' close tag the checkbox gets checked, the collapse "animation" triggers, and the display of the label changes to the '<' open tag. The settings for the #collapsible element are there to round out the transition effects and make sure it looks good.
		</p>

		<section class="blockcode">
			#box ~ #toggle:after {<br>
			<span class="indent">content: "/>";</span><br>
			}<br>
			<br>
			#box:checked ~ #toggle:after {<br>
			<span class="indent">content: "<";</span><br>
			}<br>
			<br>
			#box:checked ~ #collapsible {<br>
			<span class="indent">width: 0;</span><br>
			<span class="indent">padding: 10px 0;</span><br>
			<span class="indent">overflow: hidden;</span><br>
			}
		</section>

		<p>
			And that's it. Another fun, pure CSS widget done!
		</p>

		<h1>Master of None</h1>
		<h3>3/29/2017</h3>

		<p>
			Coincidence is when you recently right a blog post about not finding any open source projects that stroke your fancy and then a couple of days later Google announces a <a href="https://opensource.google.com" target="_blank">new site</a> that tracks their Open Source contributions. I can't make this stuff up people, true story. I'm excited to dive in and see what options are available. The Android Open Source Project is something I've been itching to contribute to but in looking at Google's guide to setting up the development environment there is a recommendation to have 100 GB worth of storage space. Unfortunately my development machine does not meet those requirements.
		</p>

		<p>
			My primary approach to finding a lasting open-source project to contribute to has been to perform some "market research". Try to find sites that track desires for solutions to real problems that people have. This has the benefit of knowing there is a market for that software and that all the time investment put into your endeavor won't be completely unappreciated. Mikael Brevik put together a <a href="https://github.com/mikaelbr/open-source-ideas" target="_blank">git repository</a> for the purpose of allowing people to open issues where they could request software solutions or collaborations on different problems. A fitting approach but I'm not totally convinced its reaching a large market of people.
		</p>

		<p>
			Still, using this approach has left me in the position where I feel like I'm coming into a project late in the game and it would take more time to learn <i>how</i> to contribute, both in getting a deeper understanding of a language and in understanding the project's contributions standards, than to actually contribute myself. Obviously this is part of what it means to be in the development field, to be able to pick up someone else's project, learn it, and help maintain it. <i>But at least if I'm working in that field it means I'm getting paid for it!</i> /s
		</p>

		<p>
			I think it seems fitting for my next project to be an open source alternative for absence management in the education system. Its a cause I'm personally invested in being a substitute teacher myself and I could write the software using any number of different languages. The current industry standard is <a href="https://aesoponline.com" target="_blank">AESOP</a> but it requires a paid subscription to a notification service that I consider insulting, not just to me but to any district that pays for their service. It will also likely require a significant amount of UX consideration and as that is my ideal position I think this project would be a perfect match for me.
		</p>
	</article>

	<article class="blogpost">
		<h1>Jack of All Trades...</h1>
		<h3>3/27/2017</h3>

		<p>
			Irony is when you run out of project ideas now that you have a nifty blog where you can share all the cool things you often work on. This is where I have been the past couple of weeks. As such I had turned my attention to the open source horizon. Oh what a promising horizon it is; wrought with untapped potential, endless possibilities, guaranteed fun, a sense of rewarding, and...
		</p>

		<p>
			...nope. I did not know where to begin. Nothing to fret over though; millions have been in this spot before and no doubt there are plenty of resources to help someone in this position. <a href="https://github.com/explore" target="_blank">GitHub's Explore</a> feature was my primary resource as I am well versed in git and have contributed in very small parts to that community. But I would like to find something bigger to work on, something to keep me occupied for a longer duration.
		</p>

		<p>
			I suppose my problem boils down to not feeling fully comfortable investing myself in a single language yet. I know a moderate amount about a lot of languages but breaking into this industry often requires a specialization, of which I would say I don't have one (yet). My language preference is likely C++ but in my area there aren't many positions that require C++ developers. Python would be a great alternative but it feels like that language market is already well-saturated. So it becomes this balancing game of trying to match a language I would enjoy and would be profitable for me to invest in with an open source project that I can also invest fully in. Turns out, that's much harder than I thought it would be!

		<h1>Revisiting CSS Toggle DropDowns</h1>
		<h3>3/18/2017</h3>

		<h5>Try a working example of this widget on jsfiddle <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/TheThinker/453xro98/" target="_blank">here</a>.</h5>

		<p>
			I worked on my proprietorship's website a couple months ago and got a beautiful, functional, toggle-able, dropdown menu working for navigational purposes. Naturally, that site is hosted from my Raspberry Pi and recently I have not had access to its files. No matter! We can rebuild it; we have the technology.
		</p>

		<p>
			This navigational menu is to be used on this very site - for the purposes of respecting responsive web design. It needs to be pure CSS (because javascript makes for horrible UX!), work across multiple browsers both desktop and mobile, and of course, it needs to look good. My approach will be to use a dropdown type of menu that employs a clickable toggle. The way this was accomplished with great support for my other website was by using a checkbox input and its clickable label and I expect to borrow that methodology.
		</p>

		<p>
			So, here is what I was able to come up with. You could of course see for yourself using various browser inspection tools but I'll assume you just want the filtered version. First, the HTML.
		</p>

		<h4>The HTML</h4>

		<p>
			The checkbox input and its label, from my testing, has served me best when included outside everything (i.e. a child only to the body tag). Here's their extremely simple code:
		</p>

		<section class="blockcode">
			&lt;input type="checkbox" id="menuCheckBox"/&gt;<br>
			&lt;label id="menuBox" for="menuCheckBox"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
		</section>

		<p>
			As you can see, its VERY simplistic as syntax goes and that's what I strive for. Note that actual text can be used if set between the opening and closing <span class="code">&lt;label&gt;</span> tags.
		</p>

		<p>
			My objective is to be able to create a navigational dropdown menu so elements I want to reveal are stored in the <span class="code">&lt;nav&gt;</span> tag. Within the <span class="code">&lt;nav&gt;</span> tag I use two generic <span class="code">&lt;div&gt;</span> containers to hold navigational links (home, about, etc.) and contact links (GitHub, Facebook, etc.), with a <span class="code">&lt;hr&gt;</span> to visually separate them. Here they are:
		</p>

		<section class="blockcode">
			&lt;nav&gt;<br>
			<span class="indent">&lt;div class="pages"&gt;</span><br>
				<span class="double-indent">...</span><br>
			<span class="indent">&lt;/div&gt;</span><br>
			<span class="indent">&lt;hr id="navDiv"/&gt;</span><br>
			<span class="indent">&lt;div class="contact"&gt;</span><br>
				<span class="double-indent">...</span><br>
				<span class="indent">&lt;/div&gt;</span><br>
			&lt;/nav&gt;
		</section>

		<p>
			Beans. Let's include some actual links in those generic <span class="code">&lt;div&gt;</span> containers to take users around the site. Here's a sample navigational menu with links to pages on the website and external social media sites.
		</p>

		<section class="blockcode">
			&lt;input type="checkbox" id="menuCheckBox"/&gt;<br>
			&lt;label id="menuBox" for="menuCheckBox"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;<br>
			<br>
			&lt;nav&gt;<br>
				<span class="indent">&lt;div class="pages"&gt;</span><br>
					<span class="double-indent">&lt;a href="index.html" class="active"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt;</span><br>
					<span class="double-indent">&lt;a href="about.html"&gt;about&lt;/a&gt;</span><br>
					<span class="double-indent">&lt;a href="blog.html"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;</span><br>
				<span class="indent">&lt;/div&gt;</span><br>
				<span class="indent">&lt;hr id="navDiv"/&gt;</span><br>
				<span class="indent">&lt;div class="contact"&gt;</span><br>
					<span class="double-indent">&lt;a href="https://github.com/nathanblair" target="_blank"&gt;</span><br>

		</section>

		<p>
			Cool beans. So that's done. On to the CSS.
		</p>

		<h4>The CSS</h4>

		<p>
			First, let's put together the checkbox functionality. We want to hide the checkbox graphic but keep its label. In my case, I want the label to be a placeholder with a background image. In that case, here's the css necessary to get the checkbox visuals right:
		</p>

		<section class="blockcode">
			/*Hide the checkbox graphic*/<br>
			#menuCheckBox {<br>
				<span class="indent">display: none;</span><br>
			}<br>
			<br>
			#menuBox {<br>
				<span class="indent">display: block;</span><br>
				<span class="indent">z-index: 5;</span><br>
				<span class="indent">background-image: url('../_res/icons/menu.png');</span><br>
				<span class="indent">background-size: 48px;</span><br>
				<span class="indent">background-repeat: no-repeat;</span><br>
				<span class="indent">background-position-x: center;</span><br>
				<span class="indent">background-position-y: center;</span><br>
				<span class="indent">height: 50px;</span><br>
				<span class="indent">padding: 8px 0;</span><br>
			}
		</section>

		<p>
			I normally swear against using hard-coded height settings but in this case, since the label element is only serving to display the background image, the height must be set explicitly otherwise the label element would not show up at all. Nominally the background image would be an icon (in my case, the hamburger menu icon), and I've explicitly set the dimensions of the icon to be 48px x 48px. From my experience, this is a manageable size on any browser regardless of desktop or mobile usage.
		</p>

		<p>
			Next, the settings for the navigation menu itself:
		</p>

		<section class="blockcode">
			nav {<br>
				<span class="indent">display: none;</span><br>
				<span class="indent">width: 100%;</span><br>
				<span class="indent">overflow: hidden;</span><br>
			}<br>
			<br>
			nav a {<br>
				<span class="indent">text-decoration: none;</span><br>
				<span class="indent">display: block;</span><br>
				<span class="indent">text-align: center;</span><br>
			}<br>
			<br>
			.pages a {<br>
				<span class="indent">/*padding: 0.5em 1em;*/</span><br>
			}<br>
			<br>
			.contact a {<br>
				<span class="indent">display: flex;</span><br>
				<span class="indent">justify-content: center;</span><br>
				<span class="indent">/*padding: 0.5em 1.3em;*/</span><br>
			}
		</section>

		<p>
			Now its time to implement the desired behavior for the toggle functionality. This is done using the <span class="code">:checked</span> pseudo-class selector. Since the <span class="code">&lt;nav&gt;</span> element and <span class="code">&lt;input&gt;</span> element are siblings, we can apply all kinds of settings to the <span class="code">&lt;nav&gt;</span> element and its children when the <span class="code">:checked</span> flag is ticked by using the <span class="code">~</span> sibling selector.
		</p>

		<section class="blockcode">
			#menuCheckBox:checked ~ nav {<br>
				<span class="indent">display: inline-block;</span><br>
				<span class="indent">z-index: 5;</span><br>
				<span class="indent">position: absolute;</span><br>
			}<br>
			<br>
			#menuCheckBox:checked ~ #menuBox {<br>
				<span class="indent">background-image: url('../_res/icons/close.png');</span><br>
			}
		</section>

		<p>
			And thats it. A sample working toggle-able navigation menu that can be used to help keep sites responsive on a wide array of devices and browsers.

		<h1>Website Update</h1>
		<h3>3/14/2017</h3>
		<p>
		Here is another major update to the website. A nominal cover photo has been included though this will likely change in the future. I've restructured the r&eacute;sum&eacute; and about sections, removed the images (as I didn't fully have permissions to release some of them), and am including these couple of blog posts. I'm still proud to share that this site runs fully javascript free and thus should be very performance-friendly. Meanwhile, a mobile/small-viewport version of the site is still in the works. The design has been mostly determined, what's left is the implementation and testing. This site is also still in desparate need of color and more attractive elements, a goal which remains high-priority and a problem I hope to remedy soon.
		</p>
		<p>
		From here on, blog posts will likely be less about this website and more about some of the projects I've built and am maintaining. Hopefully my work in some of these projects will inspire or help anyone who comes across them, much the same as others I've run across have helped me tremendously.

		<h1>Website Update</h1>
		<h3>3/11/2017</h3>
		<p>I am updating my website after a few months of no work being done to it. These changes will make the website more modern, aesthetic, easier to read and find, and provide a better demonstration of my progression as a developer.</p>
		<p>On the landing page, I'm embracing the cover photo design approach. It looks great; I like the simplicity. It is also very easy to work with when designing for responsive sites, which is what I hope to bring this site more in line with.</p>
