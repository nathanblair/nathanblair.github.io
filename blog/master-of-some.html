        Coincidence is when you recently right a blog post about not finding any open source projects that stroke your fancy and then a couple of days later Google announces a <a href="https://opensource.google.com" target="_blank">new site</a> that tracks their Open Source contributions. I can't make this stuff up people, true story. I'm excited to dive in and see what options are available. The Android Open Source Project is something I've been itching to contribute to but in looking at Google's guide to setting up the development environment there is a recommendation to have 100 GB worth of storage space. Unfortunately my development machine does not meet those requirements.

        My primary approach to finding a lasting open-source project to contribute to has been to perform some "market research". Try to find sites that track desires for solutions to real problems that people have. This has the benefit of knowing there is a market for that software and that all the time investment put into your endeavor won't be completely unappreciated. Mikael Brevik put together a <a href="https://github.com/mikaelbr/open-source-ideas" target="_blank">git repository</a> for the purpose of allowing people to open issues where they could request software solutions or collaborations on different problems. A fitting approach but I'm not totally convinced its reaching a large market of people.

        Still, using this approach has left me in the position where I feel like I'm coming into a project late in the game and it would take more time to learn <i>how</i> to contribute, both in getting a deeper understanding of a language and in understanding the project's contributions standards, than to actually contribute myself. Obviously this is part of what it means to be in the development field, to be able to pick up someone else's project, learn it, and help maintain it. <i>But at least if I'm working in that field it means I'm getting paid for it!</i> /s

        I think it seems fitting for my next project to be an open source alternative for absence management in the education system. Its a cause I'm personally invested in being a substitute teacher myself and I could write the software using any number of different languages. The current industry standard is <a href="https://aesoponline.com" target="_blank">AESOP</a> but it requires a paid subscription to a notification service that I consider insulting, not just to me but to any district that pays for their service. It will also likely require a significant amount of UX consideration and as that is my ideal position I think this project would be a perfect match for me.
