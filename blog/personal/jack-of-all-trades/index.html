		Irony is when you run out of project ideas now that you have a nifty blog where you can share all the cool things you often work on. This is where I have been the past couple of weeks. As such I had turned my attention to the open source horizon. Oh what a promising horizon it is; wrought with untapped potential, endless possibilities, guaranteed fun, a sense of rewarding, and...

		...nope. I did not know where to begin. Nothing to fret over though; millions have been in this spot before and no doubt there are plenty of resources to help someone in this position. <a href="https://github.com/explore" target="_blank">GitHub's Explore</a> feature was my primary resource as I am well versed in git and have contributed in very small parts to that community. But I would like to find something bigger to work on, something to keep me occupied for a longer duration.

		I suppose my problem boils down to not feeling fully comfortable investing myself in a single language yet. I know a moderate amount about a lot of languages but breaking into this industry often requires a specialization, of which I would say I don't have one (yet). My language preference is likely C++ but in my area there aren't many positions that require C++ developers. Python would be a great alternative but it feels like that language market is already well-saturated. So it becomes this balancing game of trying to match a language I would enjoy and would be profitable for me to invest in with an open source project that I can also invest fully in. Turns out, that's much harder than I thought it would be!
