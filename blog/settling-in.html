	<p>Alright, I've been back from Florida for 2 years. Its been a roller coaster of jobs and like many of my millenial peers, its been rough.</p>
	<p>Recently though I finally got back on track and landed a software dev position. Truly a great opportunity that I'll always be thankful for; I found a place where my skillset was noticed and appreciated. I was making enough money (and driving far enough away) that I got in the market for a new car and ended up purchasing a 2017 Nissan Rogue Sport. Fantastic car! Can't wait to take it camping!</p>
	<p>But the position was short lived as I got another offer to go back to work for the Education Outreach office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. The pay was substantial enough that it would have been fiscally irresponsible for me not to take the opportunity, so I had to say goodbye to a job I've been working extremely hard to land since before I graduated college.</p>
	<p>With the start of the new job underway, I felt very privileged to have this kind of financial security when I knew many of my peers were still having problems. I'd love to find a way to make the playing field easier for my generation; I know many of us desperately need it. Until then, I worked towards securing my professional position and started taking roots by buying a house.</p>
	<p>So far, I could hardly ask for anything better in a house. It is nice to have my own place that I can decorate as I please, hang up and install whatever I want, cook and eat whatever I wish, and have a nice place to come home to and unwind.</p>
	<p>For those millenials that are out there that are still searching and trying to find what you want out of life, I want to put it out there that you should not feel shamed for not having a house at this point in your life, or a career position. I've no doubt there are many who have worked just as hard (perhaps harder) than I have to have a nice foundation in their lives; just keep at it and I'm sure what you're searching for will come. Rest assured, your peers are not a finished product either as I know I am still not ready to completely plant roots yet in a career or location.</p>
